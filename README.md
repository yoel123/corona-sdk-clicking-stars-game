this is a simple game made using my corona sdk framework. it's a prototype to test my framework.

there is no goal to the game you click stars before they disappear and then click the sun to make them reappear.
it's just a prototype to test my framework.

soon I will make tutorials on how to use my corona sdk game framework.

there is an apk for testing on mobile.
