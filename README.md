this is a simple game made using my corona sdk framework. it's a prototype to test my framework.

there is no goal to the game you click stars before they disappear and then click the sun to make them reappear.
it's just an example game app.

soon I will make tutorials on how to use my corona sdk game framework.

"star clicking" or "star clicker" also has a java (slick2d) and javascript (phaser.js) versions using the same framework (my framework):

js:

java:
https://github.com/yoel123/yoel-java-slick2d-framework/tree/master/example%20games/clickin%20stars

khan academy code playground (ported my framework to thier js playground too):
https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/yoel-star-click/4545017716277248

so this is a port of a port using a port of a port framework (from javascript to java to corona sdk lua), I have a way I'm used to for creating games (that's why I create a framework for each engine or language I use).

now you can play clicking stars on all platforms...web, desktop, and Android (because its corona also ios).

there is an apk for testing on mobile.
